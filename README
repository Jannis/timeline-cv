TimelineCV
==========

TimelineCV is a simple interactive HTML/CSS timeline of important
events in your life. You start off by defining a number of events
categories that are displayed as columns. Events are visualized as
boxes that expand on hover in order to present additional information.
You may specify different types of events such as achievements, job
positions or vacation trips. Depending on their type, events may be
assigned different colors.

Events are modeled using a simple JSON syntax. JavaScript is used to
load event data and populate the timeline. All animations are 
entirely implemented in CSS3.


Planned Features
================

* Limit the timeline view to the time between the month of the earliest
  event and the current month.
* Allow more flexible theming by adding more options to the JSON file.
* Group empty years (starting at 2-3 consecutive empty years).
* Anything else?
